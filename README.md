# YideSpace

**YideSpace** is a 3D Space Shooter I'm currently working on. (I'm still doing everything by myself, but I hope to get some fellas working with me.)

> PS: You pronounce the *Yide* like *wide*. The *Y* thing is like my trademark. I know, super inventive...

## Documentation

I'm really exited to share all my ideas for the project with you. I have so much in mind doing and I want to make a wiki like any other game. For now I'm letting my mouth shut, because making early promises never turns out good for me.
## Feedback, Support and Contributing

As you can see, I'm combining all interactions with you guys outside of GitHub into one article. That's because I'm just going to be referencing my **YGaming** [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rbAfUKyqxr).


## Features

Like mentioned in the section above, no early promises!


## Installation

There's no download yet, so nothing to explain here.
But I can promise that there is going to be a simple **Game Launcher** that you hopefully only have to get once. It will automatically update the game. I'm already working on it but it's quite nerve racking, so all alpha version will be just the raw **Unity Build** inside a *.zip*.
## Demo

There will be downloadable demo versions of the game. As already mentioned in the Installation article, all alpha versions will be raw Unity builds.

**Version numbers to distinguish:**
1.~.~ = Alpha
2.~.~ = Beta
3.~.~ = Full Version

As you can see, my versions are divided in **Major Versions**, **Minor Versions** and **Sub-Minor Versions**.

To stay up to date, I recommend you joining my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rbAfUKyqxr). All versions and news will be there.
