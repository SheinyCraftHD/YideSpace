# YideSpace

**YideSpace** is a 3D Space Shooter I'm currently working on. (I'm still doing everything by myself, but I hope to get some fellas working with me.)

> PS: You pronounce the *Yide* like *wide*. The *Y* thing is like my trademark. I know, super inventive...

## Documentation

I'm really exited to share all my ideas for the project with you. I have so much in mind doing and I want to make a wiki like any other game. For now I'm letting my mouth shut, because making early promises never turns out good for me.

## Contact

To get in contact with me and other developers, I would be really happy if you join the **YGaming** [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rbAfUKyqxr). There you have an overview of all projects I'm and other people are working on right now.

## Downloads

The game can be downloaded and installed via the [YGaming-Launcher](https://github.com/WhyGaming/YGaming-Launcher) which is also still in beta. There is no official download for the time being, but you can dowload the source code from the repository and simply copy the already included builds. Of course you can build it yourself or commit bug-fixes.

## Demo

As mentioned above, as long as **YideSpace** itself is in alpha and the **YGaming Launcher** in beta, there will be no official demo.

## Versions

**Version numbers to distinguish:**
1.~.~ = Alpha
2.~.~ = Beta
3.~.~ = Full Version

As you can see, my versions are divided in **Major Versions**, **Minor Versions** and **Sub-Minor Versions**.

To stay up to date, I recommend you joining my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rbAfUKyqxr). All versions and news will be there.
